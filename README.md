E-learning Campaign

Welcome to the Dookhte Bartar E-learning Campaign repository! This project focuses on enhancing the company's e-learning courses in the field of clothing sewing through data-driven marketing strategies.

Project Highlights
Data Analysis: We have thoroughly analyzed three months of sales data, generously provided by Mr. Alireza Moshtaghi, the Chief Technology Officer of Dookhte Bartar. This analysis forms the foundation of our campaign strategy.

Course Selection: Using sophisticated association rule algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth, we have curated a package of the top four e-learning courses. These courses have been identified to have the highest potential for increasing sales and revenue.

Marketing Campaign: To leverage our selected courses, we have designed an engaging marketing campaign. This campaign is set to launch within the next two weeks, and its success will be a critical factor in achieving our project goals.

Publication: We are committed to transparency and sharing our results with the community. Expect to see the outcomes of our marketing campaign published here one month after its implementation.
